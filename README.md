fauxjsp
=======

Alternative JSP implementation for development use: it interprets (instead of compiling) JSP which leads to fast application startup, fast page reloads when JSPs change and eliminates the need for server restarts. Best used when developing, probably of limited use in production because of poor performance.

## Change log

0.0.5-SNAPSHOT
- ability to handle tagfiles and JSPs in classpath locations
- updated dependencies servlet-api 4.0.1, tomcat 9.0.8
- handling Unicode in response
- housekeeping

0.0.4-SNAPSHOT 
- Implemented JSP comments
- populating context and session attributes as JSP variables
- added sessionScope, contextScope, requestScope implicit objects
- added empty applicationScope implicit object
- able to iterate over arrays

## Another JSP implementation?

Yes. In short:
- a. there aren't that many (I only know of two, [Oracle JSP](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B10501_01/java.920/a96657/orajspov.htm) and [Jasper](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/jasper-howto.html))
- b. it's much faster for development and reduces application start times compared to other implementations because it interprets JSP rather than compiling it to byte code
- c. no memory leaks, more robust, more precise and helpful error messages for syntax- and runtime errors
- d. extensible

For most of you cool dudes JSP is horribly out of fashion, but I like using it for prototyping and [tagfiles](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/1.4/tutorial/doc/JSPTags5.html). Sadly and surprisingly, not many people know about tagfiles despite them being a well-supported and mature technique for creating reusable web UI components.

Starting a JSP-heavy application is slow because other JSP implementations will first compile JSP and tagfiles to java source code, then to byte code and then to machine code. Also, when making changes to JSP files, the entire process has to be repeated which slows down development. At some point you'll even get unexplainable compile errors, class loading errors, run out of memory and the likes, you'll know you've had enough and you'll restart the servlet container.

Fauxjsp implements a JSP interpreter and a [JSP servlet](https://github.com/ggeorgovassilis/fauxjsp/blob/master/src/main/java/fauxjsp/servlet/JspServlet.java) which reads JSP files and interprets them on the fly, skipping compilation altogether. This brings the benefit of instant page reloads, fast application start times and robustness (no classloader fiddling!) but, obviously, the generated JSP pages are slower under load than the standard implementation and thus fauxjsp shouldn't be used for production.

Currently implemented features:

* Renders JSP pages
* Renders tagfiles
* Supports most core JSTL taglibs
* Supports scriptlets
* Is modular and extensible
* Supports tagfiles and JSPs which reside in classpath locations

Constraints and missing features:

* Out-of-the-box only core taglibs are supported. This means that core taglibs like c:out will work but
  third party taglibs such as [displaytag](http://www.displaytag.org) won't, unless you re-implement them for fauxjsp.
* Not all core taglibs are supported and not all features of the supported ones are implemented which is not an intentional omission. Please submit a bug report if you think something is missing.
* I didn't read up on JSP/JSTL/servlet specifications. This implementation is "steer by sight" (aka "works for me").
* Servlet containers needs to provide some EL 3.0 implementation (i.e. works with Tomcat 8, not with Tomcat 7)
* I didn't read up on variable scoping; scopes work similarly to variable scopes in Java blocks.
* Encoding is pinned to UTF-8.
* Not all JSP [implicit objects](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19316-01/819-3669/bnaij/index.html) are available.
* Newline handling in output may differ from main stream JSP implementations.
* Scriptlets are implemented via [beanshell](http://www.beanshell.org) which means that there might be deviations from how scriptlets are handled in Jasper et al.
* The JSP language ecosystem is rather complex; HTML, JSTL, EL and scriptlets are frequently mixed in the same file which is hard to parse. Fauxjsp uses a very simple parser which means that it's likely to get confused by characters in EL expressions which have special meaning in XML, e.g.
"<" or ">" as strings in scriptlets, "{" or "}" as strings in EL - you might have to use [named entities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references). Note that release 0.0.4 significantly improved handling of such characters.

### With all these restrictions... why should you bother?

Because:

* JSPs and tagfiles reload instantly saving you plenty of time and server restarts.
* fauxjsp implements a subset of the JSP specification; if it works in fauxjsp, it will probably work in Jasper, too.

## Getting started

1) download sources and compile
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ggeorgovassilis/fauxjsp.git
cd fauxjsp
mvn install
```

2) add the dependency to your project

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>com.github.ggeorgovassilis</groupId>
	<artifactId>fauxjsp</artifactId>
	<version>0.0.5-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

3) Declare an instance of the JspServlet in web.xml:

```xml
<servlet>
        <servlet-name>FauxJsp</servlet-name>
        <servlet-class>fauxjsp.servlet.JspServlet</servlet-class>
<!-- optionally specify a root for resource lookup, defaults to "/"
		<init-param>
			<param-name>base-path</param-name>
			<param-value>/WEB-INF/jsp/</param-value>
		</init-param>
-->
</servlet>

<servlet-mapping>
	<servlet-name>FauxJsp</servlet-name>
	<url-pattern>*.jsp</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
```

## Run-time Dependencies

* JSP API 2.0
* Java EL 3.0 API
* JSTL 1.2
* Servlet API 4.0
* commons-lang 2.6
* beanshell 2.0b5
* log4j 4

Servlet API, JSTL, EL are scoped as ```provided``` because the servlet container or the web application contribute these dependencies

log4j, Beanshell are scoped as ```provided``` because they are optional

commons-lang is scoped as ```compile``` because it's mandatory

For up-to-date details, [please see the pom](pom.xml).

## Extending fauxjsp's functionality and working around bugs

Please submit a bug report when you find a bug or require a feature implemented. Now, in real (project) life, 
you are probably on a tight schedule and don't want to wait for an official fix. Fauxjsp is modular and easily
extensible. So have a look at the next chapter about fauxjsp's architecture which will help you understand the various,
rather simple components, how to modify them and implement new functionality.

## Architecture overview

### JspServlet

```JspServlet``` accepts an HTTP request and renders the requested JSP. The entire sequence looks like this:

1. Gets the requested JSP file's name from the ```ServletRequest```
2. Looks at ```jspbase``` (see javadocs for ```JspServlet```) for the JSP file
3. Asks the ```JspParserFactory``` for a new ```JspParser```
4. Gives the JSP file to the ```JspParser``` who parses it, recursively resolves dependencies and returns a ```JspPage```
5. Creates a new ```RenderSession```
6. Asks the ```JspRendererFactory``` for a new ```JspRenderer```
7. Gives the ```JspPage``` and ```RenderSession``` to the ```JspRenderer``` who renders it
8. Streams the results to the browser

```JspServlet``` has a bunch of protected methods which construct the various factories mentioned earlier. Should you need special setups
then overriding these constructor methods allows you to specify your own factories which can return modified or completely new implementations
of parsers and renderers.

### JspParser

The ```JspParser``` and more specifically its only implementation ```JspParserImpl``` is given a JSP file location, renders it and returns
the parsed results. In detail:

1. ```JspParser.parse(path)``` is given the path of the JSP file to render
2. The parser gives the path to a ```ResourceResolver``` instance (the ```JspParserFactory``` sets that one up) which returns
   the JSP file as a string.
3. The parser reads through the JSP file creating a tree of ```JspNode```s.
4. When the parser finds taglib (or tagfile) declarations, it puts them into the ```TagLibDefinitionCache``` which makes sure that
   taglibs are read only once during each request.
5. When the parser meets tagfile declarations, it asks the ```JspParserFactory``` for a new parser who recursively parses the tagfile.

Unfortunately, currently it is not possible to load taglibs other than tagfiles. However it is possible to use missing taglibs by providing a special implementation for fauxjsp yourself. Depending on the taglib you are trying to simulate this may or may not be
a labour-intensive task. For some examples, have a look at the ```JstlCoreTaglib*``` classes. The ```DefaultJspParserFactoryImpl``` factory sets those
up under a special namespace, one for each taglib method.

## Supported taglibs

### Directives

```xml
<%@ taglib prefix uri tagdir%>

<@ include file %>

<%@ attribute name required rtexprvalue type %>

<jsp:attribute name="...">...</jsp:attribute>

<jsp:body>...</jsp:body>

<jsp:doBody/>
```

### Core taglib

```xml
<c:out value="..."/>

<c:choose test="...">...</c:choose>

<c:when test="...">...</c:when>

<c:otherwise>...</c:otherwise>

<c:forEach var="..." items="..." varStatus="..." begin="..." end="...">...</c:forEach>

<c:if test="...">...</c:if>

<c:set var="..." value="..."/>

```

### Formatting and internationalisation

```xml
<fmt:message key="..."/>

<fmt:setBundle basename="..."/>

<fmt:formatNumber value="..." .../>

<fmt:formatDate value="..." .../>

<fmt:setLocale value="..."/>

```

### Functions

Fauxjsp delegates to the standard JSTL function implementation used by the application server, so everything should work out of the box.

If you need more function taglibs, don't forget to declare them in web.xml:
```xml
<jsp-config> 
	<taglib>
		<taglib-uri>http://java.sun.com/jstl/core-rt</taglib-uri>
		<taglib-location>META-INF/c-1_0-rt.tld</taglib-location>
	</taglib>
</jsp-config>
```
taglib-location can be a server- or classpath resource path. 

## How do I ...

### ... add a missing tag library?

As written before, fauxjsp can't use taglibs and has to emulate them instead, which means that someone has to program that emulation.

*Step 1*: create the taglib implementation. Just find one of the already simulated taglibs like [JstlCoreTaglibOut](src/main/java/fauxjsp/impl/simulatedtaglibs/core/JstlCoreTaglibOut.java) and copy & paste it

```java

public class TaglibAdd extends TaglibDefinition{

	protected void runAdd(RenderSession session, JspTaglibInvocation invocation) {
		String xExpression = invocation.getArguments().get("x");
		if (xExpression == null)
			throw new RuntimeException("Missing x argument");
		Object x = session.elEvaluation.evaluate(xExpression, session);

		String yExpression = invocation.getArguments().get("y");
		if (yExpression == null)
			throw new RuntimeException("Missing y argument");
		Object y = session.elEvaluation.evaluate(yExpression, session);
		
		try {
		    int ix = (Number)x;
		    int iy = (Number)y;
		    String s = ""+(ix+iy);
			session.response.getOutputStream().write((s).getBytes(session.response.getCharacterEncoding()));
		} catch (Exception e) {
			throw new JspRenderException(invocation, e);
		}
	}

	@Override
	public void render(RenderSession session, JspTaglibInvocation invocation) {
		runAdd(session, invocation);
	}
	
	public TaglibAdd() {
		this.name="add";
		this.attributes.put("x", new AttributeDefinition("x", Integer.class.getName(), true, true));
		this.attributes.put("y", new AttributeDefinition("y", Integer.class.getName(), true, true));
	}
}


```

*Step 2*: extend [DefaultJspParserFactoryImpl](src/main/java/fauxjsp/impl/parser/DefaultJspParserFactoryImpl.java) and override the ```setup``` method. Here you can register the new taglib you wrote

```java
	public class MyJspParserFactory extends DefaultJspParserFactoryImpl{
		
	protected void setup(JspParserImpl parser) {
	  super.setup(parser);
		parser.registerTaglibDefinition(
				"http://mytaglibs/add",
				new TaglibAdd());
	}		
	}

```

*Step 3*: extend [JspServlet](src/main/java/fauxjsp/servlet/JspServlet.java) and override ```getJspParserFactory``` so that it returns your new factory

```java
	public class MyJspServlet extends JspServlet{

	protected JspParserFactory getJspParserFactory(ServletConfig config){
		ResourceResolver location = new ServletResourceResolver(jspBase, getServletContext());
		DefaultJspParserFactoryImpl factory = new MyJspParserFactory(location);
		return factory;
	}
		
	}

```


*Step 4*: use your new JspServlet implementation in web.xml instead of the old JspServlet 

```xml
<servlet>
        <servlet-name>FauxJsp</servlet-name>
        <servlet-class>MyJspServlet</servlet-class>
</servlet>

<servlet-mapping>
	<servlet-name>FauxJsp</servlet-name>
	<url-pattern>*.jsp</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
```

### ... enable logging to see what's going on?

```JspServlet``` logs through log4j, if found on the classpath, otherwise through the standard JDK logging mechanism.
A possible logging setup in ```log4j.properties``` could look like this:

```
log4j.rootLogger=INFO, stdout
log4j.logger.fauxjsp=INFO, stdout
log4j.additivity.fauxjsp.impl.parser.JspParserImpl=false

log4j.appender.stdout=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
log4j.appender.stdout.Target=System.out
log4j.appender.stdout.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.stdout.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} %-5p %c{1}:%L - %m%n
```

### ... work with scriptlets?
[Scriptlets](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/5/tutorial/doc/bnaou.html) are implemented with the use of [beanshell](http://www.beanshell.org), thus some deviations from the standard scriptlet behavior are to be expected. Scriptlets won't be enabled
unless the Beanshell interpreter is found on the classpath. Current limitations are:

* Not all [implicit objects](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19316-01/819-3669/bnaij/index.html) are available.
* Beanshell's syntax is lenient; you can do things in Beanshell that you can't do in Java.
* Beanshell doesn't understand vararg method signatures, e.g. you can't use [String.format](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#format%28java.util.Locale,%20java.lang.String,%20java.lang.Object...%29) unless you pack arguments into an Object array. For more see [String formatting with beanshell](http://jedit.9.x6.nabble.com/String-formatting-with-beanshell-td1775061.html).

### ... deal with a fauxjsp limitation?
Ideally you'd find a way that works both in the production JSP environment as well as with fauxjsp. An example would be the case of
varargs used in scriptlets we talked about earlier. The fauxjsp parser is likely to be confused by strings that appear in EL expressions and scriptlets which are used elsewhere as delimiters like <, >, {, } etc. In that case try to use escapes like \u007B for {.

### ... reference tagfiles or JSPs which reside in the classpath?
The use case is that your tagfiles or JSPs reference other tagfiles or JSPs which reside in the classpath (eg. a JAR file).
Don't use ```tagdir``` but use ```uri``` instead when including the resource, eg:
````jsp
<%@ taglib prefix="cp" uri="classpath:/tagfiles" %>
````

## Roadmap

Features to come ~~in the near~~ sometime in the future:

* jsp:var, import
* spring mvc taglibs

Science fiction (things I have a rough idea how to implement but need to work out yet and may never come):

* wrapper for using any third-party taglib
* jsp debugger
* running in more environments
